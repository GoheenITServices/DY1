          <div style="text-align:center;"><em><span class="font-size-s">"Where do I even begin?! Ms. Darlene and her family/staff at Discovery Years have been nothing short of phenomenal to my family. My oldest son started at 18 months. Every teacher he came across (Ms. T., Ms. Destiny, Ms. Yvette, and Ms. Rossy) showered him with unconditional love. He went from crying during drop offs to running to his class eager to be there. That put my mind at ease knowing he was left in good hands and being nurtured in every aspect (even potty training). From an educational standpoint, Discovery Years fully prepared my son for his transition to elementary school. Because of their diligence in providing curriculum during the school year and summer months, my son mastered all of his objectives mid-year and is ending Kindergarten on Reading level G. My youngest son is now attending and although he has some speech delays, it feels reassuring to know he is getting the same experience with Ms. Lukie as well as the amazing teachers listed above. As an educator myself, I know how a child's early experiences deeply affect their future development. I can say without question that Ms. Darlene and her staff are very patient and go above and beyond to make sure each child's individual needs are met. I highly recommend!"<br>-- Nicole Graves</span></em></div>
