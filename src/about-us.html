                            because we offer a home-style environment that includes fun, food and excellent learning
                            with the feeling of being at home away from home.  We believe in cutting cookies, not in
                            cookie-cutter childcare.<br><br>One of first things we do is teach your little one how to be
                            friends, and we help them develop good relational skills and manners.  We enhance learning
                            by using the amazing FrogStreet curriculum.  Kids get served hot meals from Miss Annie's
                            kitchen each day!  And on some days they even get a visit from Discovery Years mascot:
                             Baron, the award winning Labrador Retriever...also known as "the Bear!"</span>

                                    here and they’ve learned so quickly and the price is great! I can’t remember the
                                    curriculum that they use but it’s great and keeps the children engaged. I would
